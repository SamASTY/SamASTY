Hi, Iâ€™m @SamASTY. I'm a science computer students in 1st year.
I love learning about database and software development, but I'm still learning.
Right now I'm practicing C, Python, Java and SQL.
I'm looking for an internship for next year (starting on april 2026) mostly in software development or database around Paris.
