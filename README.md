Hi, Iâ€™m @SamASTY. I'm a science computer students in 1st year.
I love learning about database and software development, but I'm still learning
Right now I'm practicing C, Python and SQL, and I'll learn JS in January.
I'm looking for a work-study-course for next year (starting on September 2025) mostly in software development around Paris.
